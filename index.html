<h3><strong>The Allure of Cockroach Cove</strong></h3>
Cockroach Cove is situated near the famous Halona Blowhole Lookout, a popular tourist attraction known for its dramatic ocean geyser.

The cove’s name often surprises visitors, but rest assured, it does not reflect the presence of cockroaches. The origins of the nickname remain unclear, but local lore suggests it may have been inspired by the shape of the surrounding rocks or the movement of crabs on the sand, which resemble scuttling insects.

The beauty of Cockroach Cove lies in its pristine sands, turquoise waters, and dramatic cliffs, which make it a favorite spot for photographers, nature lovers, and those seeking a peaceful escape.
